# Elections

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is work-in-progress documentation for the elections system currently under development. See [synthetix-governance.md](synthetix-governance.md "mention") for information on the current system.
{% endhint %}

The elections system is responsible for calculating a given address’s voting power, tabulating votes, and distributing NFTs to winners. This system can be deployed multiple times (for each council). The NFTs generated by this system can be integrated with other smart contracts to give the winners administrative power over other systems.&#x20;

## Epochs & Periods

Within each epoch, there are four period:

* **Administration Period** - No election is under way.
* **Nomination Period** - Nearing the end of the epoch, addresses may be nominated for election.
* **Voting Period** - After the nomination period, addresses with voting power may assign votes to nominees.
* **Evaluation Period** - Finally, voting closes and the winners are calculated. The existing NFTs are burned and new NFTs are minted to the winners.

## Voting Power

* In the V2 system, voting power is based on the amount of debt shares an address has assumed. In the V3 system, voting power is based on the amount of SNX that an account has delegated to the Spartan Council pool.
* Voting power may be calculated as linear or quadratic.

## Cross-chain

* The elections system code has been designed such that the same codebase can be deployed to every chain. One deployment can be configured as the “mothership deployment”. This deployment receives information pertaining to all the votes via cross-chain messages and sends a cross-chain message back to each deployment during the Evaluation Period, such that NFTs are burned/minted appropriately on each chain.
